Hehe. Start your journey. üòÅüòÅ

Hi. I'm a MERN Stack developer who didn't stop with MERN and learned many new things, exploring whatever I could get myself with. I have 4+ years of experience in programming, with MERN taking first place with 2.5 years. For the rest of the years, I got a job to get my own coffee. What kind of job? Of course, as a MERN Stack developer. Click here to see my work experience. I've successfully graduated with an M.Sc. in Computer Science from DB Jain College. I also had a wonderful college life (Credits go to the Coronavirus). And I think that's all about me. For more info, scroll down more to know more or Click here to contact me.

## Work Experience

### Invus Infotech (OPC) Pvt. Ltd.

#### Full-Stack Developer ( MERN + Typescript ) | Dec 2023 - Present

As a Full-Stack Developer, I develop web apps and mobile apps based on the real-estate domain. By working on this project, I got to know more about the difficulties of a full-stack developer but still managed to build and maintain the applications. For the development environment, I chose Webstorm for Web App & Intellij Idea Ultimate for Mobile App.

### Hashhackcode

#### Junior Web Developer - Mern Stack  |  Nov 2022 - Dec 2023

As a Junior Web Developer, I gained immense knowledge of how to create an industry-standard application by using various tools and writing clear code. I was assigned to create a web app which is a learning platform for neurodiverse children to learn coding with a gamified user flow. The development process was a little hard as the application required accessibility features implemented to get utilized by a wide range of audiences.
